This repository contains R codes for implementing the sDist algorithm in our paper Boosted Nonlinear Nonlinear Metric Learning. See the original paper [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sam.11307/full).

### Summary

- The main sDist algorithm is in ./lib/sDist_algorithm.R
- All auxillary functions are saved in ./lib
- An example of using sDist algorithm on the Madelon data is given in main.R
- The Madelon data is stored in ./data
